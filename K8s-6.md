## Kubernetes

Note: Scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods inside cluster
```
k get pods -n kube-system | grep scheduler
kube-scheduler-nk-control-plane            1/1     Running   2 (11m ago)   36
```
Scheduler itself running as pod.\
QQ: who will schedule these pods?
### Static pods
```
kubelet will run this pods
```
Note: kubelet will always monitor this directory (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/)
#### These are static pods manifest 
```
docker exec -it nk-control-plane bash
root@nk-control-plane:/# cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
root@nk-control-plane:/etc/kubernetes/manifests# ls
etcd.yaml  kube-apiserver.yaml  kube-controller-manager.yaml  kube-scheduler.yaml
```
#### Move Scheduler manifest file to /tmp
```
root@nk-control-plane:/etc/kubernetes/manifests# mv kube-scheduler.yaml /tmp
```
```
k get po -n kube-system | grep scheduler

Nothing was shown
```
#### Create pod
```
k run nginx --image=nginx

k get po
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     Pending   0          22s

k describe po nginx
Node:             <none>
Status:           Pending
```
### Manual Schedule of POD's
- if yaml consist `nodeName:` then scheduler will not pick this, direcly goes to specified nodeName.
- if yaml not consist `nodeName:` then scheduler will pick this and schedule pods.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: nginx-new
  name: nginx-new
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx-new
  nodeName: nk-worker2
```
```
k apply -f static.yaml
```
```
k get po
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-new   1/1     Running   0          3s
```
```
k get po --selector tier=fe

k get po --selector tier=be
